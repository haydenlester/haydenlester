I'm Hayden, I'm a quality-oriented developer based out of the DFW metroplex.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on GroundSway, a productivity app catered towards people with ADHD
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software architecture, and soft-skills to enhance my decision-making and ideation value
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend projects, especially ones with a chance to learn more about cloud engineering
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my commitment to accessibility in software
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

### My grand goals
- I want to learn new things. I enjoy learning, and personal growth. As a result, (Almost, see below) all of my decisions are made around the growth that can be provided to me.
- Above all else, I want to be remembered as a fantastic father. I could romanticize it, but my commitment to my daughter comes before any obligation or ambition I may have.

### Stuff I find interesting:
1. It is [proven](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003) that intelligence-based praise can undermine future performance in children. Believing yourself to be smart, talented, or intelligent, is ultimately counterproductive to your goals in learning. It has been shown repeatedly that re-framing learning with a "growth mindset", and realizing that you've gotten where you are due to effort alone, helps you avoid staying in your comfort zone and refusing to challenge yourself with hard problems or big goals. You aren't smart, you're just a hard worker, an ambitious person, passionate about what you do. Take pride in it.

3. Not all businesses with legacy or poorly-designed monolithic APIs need a complete rebuild or modernization. I'm a big fan of [BFF Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends), as a means of providing a cost-effective solution to backend-derived technical debt. It isn't ideal for singular frontends, but market constraints rarely are, and it is often a lot cheaper and faster to massage the data inbetween the two than redo the API. It can also be applied to prevent or minimize backend-derived bottleneck in a project, especially if you're working with multiple frontends.
   
5. The importance of accessibility in software cannot be understated. Every accessible web or mobile application is an opportunity to expand your audience reach and your revenue. From high-contrast themeing to restricting users in ways that simplify their interactions, we can all do better about being a little more inclusive, and we have plenty of motivations to do so. I'm quite idealistic when it comes to bending over backwards for accessibility, and I think it should be a primary consideration for any UI/UX work. _Can anyone use this?_
