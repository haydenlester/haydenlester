### About me
I've been programming on and off since I was ~12 years old, so over 10 years now including the four I spent at university. I've always liked being a creator, but haven't always had the mental tools to stay consistent or finish projects. Over the last couple of years, I have focused intently on developing those mental tools, leading to a passion for software accessibility.

I'm a young father of a young daughter, and an out-of-the-box thinker. I like to use what I've learned to generate new inferences and hypothesize about how I can make existing systems better, more modular, more performant, and more accessible. I enjoy having the know-how to break the "general rule" and do better than it. I enjoy innovating, ideating, and tinkering with new code-fueled ideas.

I very strongly enjoy learning about new frameworks, technologies, concepts, and the like. "Mixing things up" so to speak. I'm not one to hide my incompetence in a new subject. I find that often occurs at the expense of furthering my learning and growth, so it would contradict my primary goal.
