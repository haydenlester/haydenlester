### My grand goals
- I want to be "the guy" one day. As a result, (Almost, see below) all of my decisions are made around the growth that can be provided to me. That's going to take a lot of hard work and dedication, but it is something I'm willing to work hard for.
- Above all else, I want to be remembered as a fantastic father. I could romanticize it, but my commitment to my daughter comes before any obligation or ambition I may have.

### Stuff I find interesting:
1. It is [proven](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003) that intelligence-based praise can undermine future performance in children. Believing yourself to be smart, talented, or intelligent, is ultimately counterproductive to your goals in learning. It has been shown repeatedly that re-framing learning with a "growth mindset", and realizing that you've gotten where you are due to effort alone, helps you avoid staying in your comfort zone and refusing to challenge yourself with hard problems or big goals. You aren't smart, you're just a hard worker, an ambitious person, passionate about what you do. Take pride in it.

3. Not all businesses with legacy or poorly-designed monolithic APIs need a complete rebuild or modernization. I'm a big fan of [BFF Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends), as a means of providing a cost-effective solution to technical debt. It isn't ideal, but market constraints rarely are.
   
4. Sometimes, understanding and learning to operate within market constraints is essential to your growth as a developer. We often have a tendency to suggest changes that provide a lot of value, but fail when it comes to understanding the stakeholder's motivations. Not everyone can afford to spend a lot of time to re-plumb the whole house. You have to be flexible, but also willing to push back on project oversights when it is necessary, in order to maintain professional responsibility.

5. I believe that professional responsibility isn't solely the developer's problem. They should be able to draw the line and respect when an engineer tells them they're making an oversight. It is nervewracking to be paying an engineer to fix an issue that you don't see and don't understand. But the only reason you'll never see it is because you did. If you can't have faith in the professionals you are employing, perhaps you should not be employing those professionals. Or, at the very least, pay someone to do it for you.
   
6. The importance of accessibility in software cannot be understated. Every accessible web or mobile application is an opportunity to expand your audience reach and your revenue. From high-contrast themeing to restricting users in ways that simplify their interactions, we can all do better about being a little more inclusive, and we have plenty of motivations to do so. I'm quite idealistic when it comes to bending over backwards for accessibility, and I think it should be a primary consideration for any UI/UX work. _Can anyone use this?_
