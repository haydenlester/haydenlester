### You should know:
1. It is [proven](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003) that intelligence-based praise can undermine future performance in children. Believing yourself to be smart, talented, or intelligent, is ultimately counterproductive to your goals in learning. It has been shown repeatedly that re-framing learning with a "growth mindset", and realizing that you've gotten where you are due to effort alone, helps you avoid staying in your comfort zone and refusing to challenge yourself with hard problems or big goals.

Not all businesses with legacy or poorly-designed monolithic APIs need a complete rebuild or modernization. I'm a big fan of [BFF Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends), as a means of providing a cost and time-effective solution to technical debt. It isn't ideal, but market constraints rarely are.
