### About me
I've been programming on and off since I was ~12 years old, so over 10 years now including the four I spent at university. I've always liked being a creator, but haven't always had the mental tools to stay consistent or finish projects. Over the last couple of years, I have focused intently on developing those mental tools, leading to a passion for software accessibility and my most recent project, GroundSway.

I'm a young father of a young daughter, and an out-of-the-box thinker. I like to use what I've learned to generate new inferences and hypothesis about how I can make existing systems better, more dynamic, more integrated, more accessible. I enjoy having the know-how to break the "general rule" and do better. I enjoy innovating, ideating, and testing my hypothesis on the systems I create.

### Stuff I find interesting:
1. It is [proven](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003) that intelligence-based praise can undermine future performance in children. Believing yourself to be smart, talented, or intelligent, is ultimately counterproductive to your goals in learning. It has been shown repeatedly that re-framing learning with a "growth mindset", and realizing that you've gotten where you are due to effort alone, helps you avoid staying in your comfort zone and refusing to challenge yourself with hard problems or big goals. You aren't smart, you're just a hard worker, an ambitious person, passionate about what you do. Take pride in it.

3. Not all businesses with legacy or poorly-designed monolithic APIs need a complete rebuild or modernization. I'm a big fan of [BFF Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends), as a means of providing a cost-effective solution to backend-derived technical debt. It isn't ideal for singular frontends, but market constraints rarely are, and it is often a lot cheaper and faster to massage the data inbetween the two than redo the API. It can also be applied to prevent or minimize backend-derived bottleneck in a project, especially if you're working with multiple frontends.
   
5. The importance of accessibility in software cannot be understated. Every accessible web or mobile application is an opportunity to expand your audience reach and your revenue. From high-contrast themeing to restricting users in ways that simplify their interactions, we can all do better about being a little more inclusive, and we have plenty of motivations to do so. I'm quite idealistic when it comes to bending over backwards for accessibility, and I think it should be a primary consideration for any UI/UX work. _Can anyone use this?_
