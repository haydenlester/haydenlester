### You should know:
1. It is [proven](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003) that intelligence-based praise can undermine future performance in children. Believing yourself to be smart, talented, or intelligent, is ultimately counterproductive to your goals in learning. It has been shown repeatedly that re-framing learning with a "growth mindset", and realizing that you've gotten where you are due to effort alone, helps you avoid staying in your comfort zone and refusing to challenge yourself with hard problems or big goals.

3. Not all businesses with legacy or poorly-designed monolithic APIs need a complete rebuild or modernization. I'm a big fan of [BFF Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends), as a means of providing a cost-effective solution to technical debt. It isn't ideal, but market constraints rarely are.
   
4. Sometimes, understanding and learning to operate within market constraints is essential to your growth as a developer. We often have a tendency to suggest changes that provide a lot of value, but fail when it comes to understanding the stakeholder's motivations. Not everyone can afford to spend a lot of time to re-plumb the whole house. You have to be flexible, and attentive.
   
5. Accessibility in software is extremely important. Every accessible web or mobile application is an opportunity to expand your audience reach and your revenue. From high-contrast themeing to restricting users in ways that simplify their interactions, we can all do better about being a little more inclusive, and we have plenty of motivations to do so.
